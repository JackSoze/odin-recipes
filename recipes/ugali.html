        <img src="../images/ugali.jpg" alt="picture of a nice ugali">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ugali is like a porridge but much more dense made from white maize meal or maize flour. It is 
        the staple diet of the indigenous people of East Africa. Also known as Nsima it is generally 
        enjoyed with a vegetable and/or meat stew. People at the coast and around Lake Victoria enjoy 
        it with fish.</p>
        <p>Ugali is also served with nyama choma which is grilled meat and kachumbari, a tomato onion 
            salad. One of the most easiest dish to prepare, it is not only rich in fiber but also is a 
            good source of carbohydrates, minerals and Vitamin B. And it is gluten free and vegan friendly.</p>
