        </ul>
        <h2>steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cut your beef into stewing chunks.</strong> Season it with a teaspoon of salt, curry powder,
                 turmeric, smoked paprika, and black pepper, and allow it to marinate for at least 
                 30 minutes or overnight for best results.</li>
            <li><strong>Using your blender or hand mixer,</strong> process onion, the remaining salt, tomato, red bell pepper, 
                and tomato puree. Use a pestle and mortar to grind the garlic and ginger. <em>Alternatively</em>, process 
                the garlic and ginger with the tomatoes in the blender if you prefer.</li> 
            <li><strong>Under high heat, heat a medium-sized pot or pan then add the oil.</strong> Add the beef chunks and allow them to brown 
                (about 2-3 minutes) on each side. Turn and allow the other side to brown for about 2 minutes, then stir in the 
                garlic and ginger. Fry for a further 2 minutes until fragrant then add the blended tomato mixture and stir.
                <p><em>If making this on the stovetop,</em> simmer for 40-45 minutes, stirring from time to time. You can add more water 
                if you prefer your stew to have more sauce.</p></li>
